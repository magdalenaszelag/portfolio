# About Me
My name is Magdalena SzelÄ…g. I am a Master of Management. I graduated from the University of Warsaw in Poland. Recently, I started to be interested in software testing. I am fascinated by the possibilities of internet technologies. My goal is to develop knowledge and technical skills related to testing so that I can ensure the quality of the software that reaches users. On this page, I would like to share my entire experience.
